# UnsupervisedLearning
*This is an unsupervised learning project written by Python Notebook. The main purpose is to help manufacturing companies, such as Nike and Tesla, find suitable cities to build factories.* 

## Raw Data:
Dataset: Movehub City Rankings 
Reference: Blitzer. (2017). Movehub City Rankings. https://www.kaggle.com/blitzr/movehub-city-rankings

## Technical used include:
**Clusterability**:  
Hopkin's statistics  
t-SNE plot  

**Algorithms**:  
Hierarchical Clustering (complete linkage and average linkage)  
k-means  
Fuzzy c-means  

**Evaluation**:  
Silhouette plot  
Boxplot

## Limitations:
In addition to quantitative data, issues such as local policies and public sentiment are also worthy of consideration.
